            ⭐️Hi! My name is Yiching Jiang, and you can call me Yiching. I live in Taichung, Taiwan. My hometown is
            Taichung.
            Taichung is a younger, powerful and cheerful place. In addition, there are many delicate and appetizing
            foods around this city. <br>
            <br>
            ⭐️I have a brother and parents in my home. I love my family very much. Sometimes I will travel on weekends
            with my good friends. And the travel is brilliant and has great scenery to watch. I enjoy the landscape
            around this travel and the trip makes me relax. Moreover, my parents teach me to become a polite person and
            be responsible to myself. It is a good thing for me that I become an independent person. <br>
            <br>
            ⭐️My hobby is reading extracurricular books and listening to the music. I enjoy reading the books which can
            cultivate my body and spirit. Because I think this type of books brings my spirit to grow up and it would
            help in the future, I love it. I like listening to the music, which is soft and comfortable. Sometimes
            listening to this type of music can make my mood pleasant. I hope I have a chance to work here to extend my vision and improve my
            program ability. Moreover, accumulating my experience and enhancing the ability of dealing with projects are
            beneficial to me. <br>
            <br>
            ⭐️The website I used to work at the university is HEIMAVISTA system, which is similar to a blog editor.
Later, I found that html and CSS grammar is very attractive. By modifying the grammar, I can make different changes to the text and function for website design layout.
Next, I learn jQuery, bootstrap, and font awesome, and found that web technology has been innovating, and there are many interesting functions, so I continued to explore program I do for learning and keeping curiosity.
 <br>
            <br>
            ⭐️Thank you.
